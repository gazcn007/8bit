# 👾 Super Mario Geek Portfolio 🚀

_Let's-a go! This portfolio is styled straight out of the Mushroom Kingdom! Power up, stomp Goombas, and navigate a pixel-perfect journey through my geeky/techy world—Mario style!_

## 🍄 Tech Stack

- React 18 – The super star of UI frameworks
- TypeScript – For code that will never throw a blue shell at you
- Vite – Like pressing B, but for build speed
- React Router DOM – Warp pipes between worlds
- Framer Motion – Pixel-perfect movement, no laggy jumps
- Tailwind CSS – Edit styles faster than a Fire Flower upgrades Mario
- Lucide React Icons – 1-UP your icons

## 💾 Warp Pipe: Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 🎨 Customize Your World

Every world has its own Mario Kart color scheme & pattern:
- **Home**: 1-UP Green (#00FF41) grid (Title Screen Vibes)
- **About**: Fire Mario Orange (#FF6B35) with pixel dots
